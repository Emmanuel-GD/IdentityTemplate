# IdentityTemplate
A projecet to help start with aspnet core Identity.
I have made this project after following Asp.Net Core Tutorial(https://csharp-video-tutorials.blogspot.com/2019/01/aspnet-core-tutorial-for-beginners.html) of kudvenkat. 
After completing the tutorial i was inpired to create a project that i can use in the future when i develop another software and created this project covering only the 
Identity part (starting from part 65) and included the logging later.

The project includes User registration, login, password reset, change password, creating, editing and deleting roles, managing user roles, managing user claims, External login(google and facebook)
Authorization(role based..follow the tutorial if you need claims based authroization and custom authroization requirements from part 98 - 103 demonstrated clearly by venkat k.)

i want to thank Kudvenkat for his efforts!
